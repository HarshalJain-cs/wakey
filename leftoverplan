# Wakey — Leftover Plan (Done vs Remaining)

**Date:** February 2, 2026  
**Scope:** MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md coverage

---

## What’s Done (or Partially Implemented)

### Foundation / Architecture
- Monorepo structure with `apps/desktop` and shared `packages/*`.
- Electron main/preload/renderer split with IPC bridge.
- Activity tracking pipeline in main process (polling + store).
- Electron build configuration and packaging script scaffolding present.

### Core Features
- Focus timer UI and logic (Pomodoro + presets).
- Task management UI and CRUD (local store).
- Dashboard + widgets (activity, focus, insights, streaks).
- Knowledge management (notes, knowledge graph, flashcards).
- Achievements page + enhanced achievements service (scaffolded).

### AI & Insights (scaffolded)
- AI insights widget + service (mock data).
- Multi‑model consensus service (mock provider routing).
- “Developer Dashboard” GitHub integration view (REST + GraphQL).

### Health & Wellness (scaffolded)
- Health page UI.
- Burnout, sleep, and wearable services (mock data).
- Wearable integration service with provider list and mock sync.

### Integrations (scaffolded)
- GitHub, Linear, Jira, Notion, Slack, Todoist integration classes.
- OAuth flow scaffolding in integrations.
- IPC bridge for GitHub REST + GraphQL via main process.

### Advanced Features (scaffolded)
- Recurring task service.
- Task dependency service.
- Team collaboration service.
- Offline sync service (queueing mock).

### Security & Utilities (partial)
- Secure storage helper (keytar + encryption) present.
- Input sanitization utilities (DOMPurify + URL/filename sanitizers).
- Audit logger scaffold.

## What’s Remaining (From MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)

### Phase 1 — Foundation
- **Database migration to SQLite** (schema + real storage in main).
- **Error handling** (retry/structured logging/event bus integration).
- **Input validation** (Zod across IPC + services).
- **Testing foundation** (unit test coverage >40%, CI config).

### Phase 2 — Core Excellence
- **Enhanced focus features** (fatigue scoring, adaptive breaks wired to real data).
- **Deep work tracking** (real metrics, context switching, flow detection).
- **Trends & predictive analytics** (weekly/monthly views + reports).
- **Gamification v2** (challenges, leaderboards, real progress).
- **Health/wearables** (real device APIs, not mocks).

### Phase 3 — Integrations
- Real token exchange + refresh for OAuth providers.
- Two‑way sync for tasks/issues/calendar.
- Webhook ingestion where supported.
- 100+ integrations target: only a subset scaffolded.

### Phase 4 — Advanced Features
- Recurring tasks + dependencies wired to persistence.
- Team collaboration with real workspaces, roles, sharing, and sync.
- Offline sync queue with conflict resolution.
- Workflow automation builder.

### Phase 5 — Polish & Distribution
- UX polish (visualization layers, accessibility, onboarding).
- Performance profiling and optimization targets.
- Security hardening (keychain storage everywhere, audit log storage, CSP tightening).
- Production build pipeline (signing, auto‑update release flow, installers).

### Cross‑Cutting Gaps
- **Testing**: coverage minimal.
- **Documentation**: user/dev guides not created.
- **Monitoring/telemetry**: no error reporting or diagnostics.
- **Data export**: CSV/JSON/PDF not implemented for core entities.

## Next Recommended Execution Order
1. Foundation (DB, validation, logging, tests).
2. Wire core features to real data (focus, analytics).
3. Finish top integrations with actual OAuth + sync.
4. Advanced features + automation.
5. Polish + distribution pipeline.
